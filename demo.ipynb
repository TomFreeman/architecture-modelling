    "* Have you ever felt the problem with architectural diagrams is they are _too visual_?\n",

    "I was looking for a way to visualise a complex architecture, that allowed me to include some often-overlooked concepts as _reliability_ and _ownership_. Not finding a modelling tool that would fit my needs, I turned to what I always turned to - I wrote some code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the result, a simple DSL for describing architectures that can then be used to generate diagrams of a variety of flavours, from a single source of truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "### No, really, Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "By creating a DSL in code, we gain two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can create complex hierarchies that are difficult to visualise (but still reflective of the truth of the system), and then create simplified visualisations without losing fidelity.\n",
    "1. We can test our architecture, validate best practices and search for pain points directly from the architecure model.\n",
    "\n",
    "By modelling the architecture, and not simply diagramming it, we can test our assumptions, validate our behaviours and estimate the reliability and performance of your architecture before you've written a single line of code. (Except for these ones.)\n",

    "## Enough waffle\n",
    "\n",
    "You're right, let's do a demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
