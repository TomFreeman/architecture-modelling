    "I was looking for a way to visualise a complex architecture, that allowed me to include some often-overlooked concepts as _reliability_ and _ownership_. Not finding a modelling tool that would fit my needs, I turned to what I always turned to - I wrote some code.\n",

    "\n",
    "By creating a DSL in code, we gain two things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can create complex hierarchies that are difficult to visualise (but still reflective of the truth of the system), and then create simplified visualisations without losing fidelity.\n",
    "1. We can test our architecture, validate best practices and search for pain points directly from the architecure model.\n",
    "\n",
